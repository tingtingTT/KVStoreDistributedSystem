### Project Description

The goal of the project is to develop a distributed key-value store that can contain lots of data: At least in principle, more data than can fit into a single machine. It provides a key-value store that is scalable, re-sizable as well as fault/partition tolerant. The primary method using for partitioning a key-value store across machines is random placement.
